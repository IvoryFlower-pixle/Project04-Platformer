Description

## Implementation
- Added multiple levels, 3 in total plus 2 if we count the title screen and end screen
- made each level really big
- added music and sound effects (Made by me)
- added new assets with the player and enemy assets made by me
- There is the use of a wall jump in the game, tho I don't know if that counts for the point
